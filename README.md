# MGM (Metric Graph Model) Project

## Introduction

This project is centered around the development of the MGM (Metric Graph Model), a model that abstracts the concepts of security metrics and their implementability. In the MGM graph, nodes represent security metrics, clusters, inputs, and sources. This structure allows for the construction of a security metric through a defined sequence. We have formally addressed the first problem associated with improving security awareness, termed *implementability*. A security metric is deemed implementable if it is linked to one or more sources that facilitate its implementation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the MGM project, you'll first need to install the required dependencies and then run the web application. Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the project, make sure you have Python installed on your system. This project has been tested on Python 3.8 and above. You can download Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone [https://github.com/andreasorrentino/Metric-Management-Graph](https://github.com/andreasorrentino/Metric-Management-Graph)
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Metric-Management-Graph
3. Install the required Python dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt


This will start the web application on your local machine. You can access it by visiting `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.
